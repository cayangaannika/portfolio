Hello my name is Annika Cayanga.
Growing up, my family and I moved places quite often. I ended up being exposed to many different cultures and that influenced my interest in the arts and design. Because I moved from country to country, the travel bug has stuck to me. Traveling has enabled me to explore new places and to get an insight on the beauty of different architectures, sculptures, and paintings. These inspired me to become the artist that I am today. I am still constantly exploring different aspects of design which helps me nurture my skills further.

I enjoy bringing my camera and go pro on 8 hour hikes. You can catch me sipping on a good cup of vanilla latte while slurping on a delicious bowl of ramen. I would happily get paid in bowls of ramen or lattes!
