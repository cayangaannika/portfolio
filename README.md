Hello my name is Annika Cayanga.
Growing up, my family and I moved places quite a bit. I ended up being exposed to many different cultures and that influenced my interest in the arts and design. I am still constantly exploring different aspects of design which helps me nurture my skills further. I am proficient in Branding, UI/UX design, Illustration and Photography.

I enjoy bringing my camera and go pro on 8 hour hikes. You can catch me sipping on a good cup of vanilla latte while slurping on a delicious bowl of ramen. I would happily get paid in bowls of ramen or lattes!
