    <p class="desc-cefo"><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The Catholic Education Foundation of Ottawa raise funds to
help alleviate poverty for students in the Ottawa Catholic
School Board. This organization also provides for families
who are experiencing financial crisis and can’t afford basic
needs such as food, clothing and transportation. By donating
to this organization, it can have an immediate impact on the
life of a child. Donation in any amount can contribute towards
putting food on the table, clothing for the winter or helping a
family with financial issues. By doing so, this will influence a
child’s education for the better.</p>

    <p class="needs-3"><strong>NEEDS:</strong> The original logo has potential but improvements could be made to
create a more simple and dynamic feel. Simple changes such as the colour palette and shape will benefit the
overall look of the brand and its purpose. Using light bold colours and
dynamic shapes will help customers remember what the brand exists for.
Looking at the original logo by itself, customers may get confused on
what the logo is trying to portray. Adding the abbreviation of the charitie’s
name will help enhance the uniqueness of their brand.</p>
