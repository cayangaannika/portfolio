      <p>Hello my name is Annika! Aspiring <strong class="emphasize-me-2">Graphic Designer</strong>.</p>
      <p>Growing up, my family and I moved places quite often. I ended up being exposed to many different cultures and that influenced my interest in the arts and design.
      Because I moved from country to country, the travel bug has stuck to me. Traveling and meeting new people has enabled me to explore new places and to get an insight on the beauty of different histories, architectures, sculptures, and paintings.
      These inspired me to become the designer that I am today.</p>

      <p>I am constantly exploring different aspects of design which helps me nurture my skills further.
      You can catch me sipping on a good cup of vanilla latte or slurping on a delicious bowl of ramen.
      I would happily get paid in bowls of ramen or lattes! Well... maybe for the first meeting haha</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading! Contact me for any inquiries. Doesn't have to be design related.
      I enjoy a good ol' chat!</p>
